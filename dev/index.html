           Hack for Humanity is Santa Clara University's premier code-focused, social good hackathon. In the span of 24-hours, college and graduate students from SCU, San Jose State, Stanford, and other schools are invited to come and solve pressing social issues that people face in communities near and far with creativity, code, and a little sweat. Standout apps with high quality technology and great potential for good will win cash prizes and potentially, if desired, support for bringing your project to life in the real world! Team up with your friends and push yourself to learn, build, and have fun, all in the name of servicing others.

          Many schools in resource-limited developing nations lack the basic necessities to provide enhanced education, such as infrastructure, Internet access, and educational content, like textbooks. Looma, developed by tech industry veteran Skip Stritter and David Sowerwine of VillageTech Solutions, is a portable computer and projector box designed for use in schools in developing nations.
          <br/>
          It uses a wand to navigate the screen, like an electronic whiteboard. The computer runs Ubuntu, will run any web-app, and the hardware is extensible. It uses batteries recharged by solar power, and provides Internet connection over any mobile data network and Wi-Fi. A number of Looma boxes have already been deployed in classrooms in Nepal. VillageTech Solutions is constantly looking for more educational content and applications to load onto Looma, as well as hardware modifications to improve the tool. We have a few Looma boxes at the hackathon for students to work with and test their projects. For more information, click here.

          <h5>Who can attend?</h5>
            The hackathon is open to all college and graduate students who can make the trip. A school email is required for registration.

          <h5>When and where is it taking place?</h5>
          February 27-28th, Locatelli Activity Center, Santa Clara University from 10am-10am.

          <h5>I've never been to a Hackathon, is that okay?</h5>
          Absolutely! There are lots of beginners at every hackathon. Hackathons are a great way to develop your skills and see what you can accomplish.

          <h5>Do I have to develop for the prompts?</h5>
          You do not. While development for the Looma project is encouraged, you are free to develop applications with some other humanitarian issue in mind, and will still be considered for the prizes.

          <h5>What is the team size?</h5>
          Teams must be comprised of four or less people.

          <h5>I don't have a team...</h5>
          That's perfectly fine! We will help link you up with other students looking for teammates, and you can also fly solo if you'd prefer.

          <h5>I have another question...</h5>
          No problem! Contact Robbie at raldrich@scu.edu and he'll be happy to clear things up.

            We need help making our dream for Hack for Humanity a reality. As a sponsor, you have the opportunity to engage with young, talented engineers and designers making a big impact, and allow them to learn about you and your organization. If desired, sponsors can promote the use of their APIs and technology, gain access to student resumes and code repos, and have the chance to see students' work as they build it.Please contact us at santaclara.acm@gmail.com if you are interested.
